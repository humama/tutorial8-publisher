a. The number of data that a publisher program sends to the message broker in one run depends entirely on the design and implementation of the publisher program. It could send one message, multiple messages, or even none at all if there are no messages to send. The frequency and volume of data sent by the publisher program are determined by its logic and purpose within the application.

b. If both the publisher and subscriber programs are configured with the same URL, `amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672`, it means they are connecting to the same AMQP broker using the same credentials and network settings. This allows them to communicate effectively through the broker. The URL specifies the protocol (`amqp`), the username and password for authentication (`guest:guest`), and the hostname and port number of the broker (`localhost:5672`). Having the same URL ensures that both the publisher and subscriber are connecting to the same messaging infrastructure, enabling them to exchange messages seamlessly.
